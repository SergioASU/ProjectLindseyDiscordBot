# ProjectLindseyDiscordBot
Programmed in Python

Bot used on Discord. Features included:

Given a summoner name, would return that person's rank, wins, and losses for the game League of Legends. This had to call Riot Games' API and parse the return json string to get relevant information

Would post to its own Twitter account when given the !tweet command

Would post random posts from reddit given various commands like:

!aww
!meme
!news etc

Would parse through a text file of possible themes for League of Legends and return 1 of them when given a !themes command
